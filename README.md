Cracking the Code: Design and Analysis of a Hybrid Cipher
This repository contains the implementation of a hybrid cipher that combines substitution (using a modified Hill Cipher) and transposition techniques to achieve robust encryption with at least 128-bit security strength.
The hybrid approach ensures resistance against classical cryptanalysis methods such as frequency analysis and linear algebra attacks.
